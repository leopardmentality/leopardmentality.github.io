Welcome to my Mandarin Journey! I'm Jazz, an adventurous woman diving headfirst into the captivating realm of Mandarin Chinese. Follow along as I navigate this language landscape, starting from scratch. My husband created this blog to share the highs, lows, and hilarious moments of my journey. With no prior knowledge, I invite you to witness the twists and turns of my progress. Join our community, be part of my triumphs, and maybe even share a laugh at my missteps. Together, let's unravel the beauty of Mandarin, one character at a time. This is my space to learn, grow, and embrace the joy of discovery. Come explore Mandarin with me, Jazz â€“ where every word is a brushstroke on my cultural canvas!
